# Task List App

## Description
This project is a simple To-Do List application built for practice using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Local Storage**. The app allows users to manage their tasks by adding, marking as completed or incomplete, and deleting tasks. The focus is on functionality and persistence, making it a practical tool for managing daily tasks.

The project focuses on:
- **DOM manipulation** to dynamically update the interface.
- **Event handling** for user interactions.
- Using **Local Storage** to ensure persistent data across browser sessions.

## Features
- **Task Management**:
  - Add tasks by typing in the input box and clicking the "Add" button.
  - Mark tasks as completed or incomplete by clicking on them.
  - Delete tasks using the "×" (cross) icon.
  - Tasks are saved in the browser's **Local Storage**, ensuring they persist across page reloads and browser restarts.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the app, including the input box and task list.
- **CSS**: Styles the app to make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the dynamic functionality of adding, deleting, and marking tasks.
- **Local Storage**: Stores the task list persistently in the browser.

## How It Works
### Task List Features
1. **Adding Tasks**: Write a task in the input box and click the "Add" button. If the input box is empty, an alert will be shown.
2. **Marking Tasks**: Click on a task to toggle its completion status, indicated by a "checked" class.
3. **Deleting Tasks**: Click the "×" icon to remove a task from the list.
4. **Persistent Data**: Tasks are saved in **Local Storage**, ensuring they persist even after refreshing or reopening the browser.

## Future Improvements
- Add an option to **edit tasks** directly within the list.
- Implement **category tags** to organize tasks (e.g., work, personal, errands).
- Introduce **dynamic themes** that change based on the time of day or user preferences.
- Enhance **responsiveness** for better compatibility with mobile and tablet devices.
- Include **progress tracking**, showing the percentage of completed tasks.
